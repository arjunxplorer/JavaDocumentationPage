            <p>"Java is an Object-Oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the early 1990s.
                The team initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, 
                television, etc. Originally C++ was considered to be used in the project but the idea was rejected 
                for several reasons(For instance C++ required more memory). Gosling endeavoured to alter and expand 
                C++ however before long surrendered that for making another stage called Green. James Gosling and his 
                team called their project “Greentalk” and its file extension was .gt and later became to known as “OAK”. 
                Why “Oak”? The name Oak was used by Gosling after an oak tree that remained outside his office. 
                Also, Oak is an image of solidarity and picked as a national tree of numerous nations like the U.S.A., 
                France, Germany, Romania, etc. But they had to later rename it as “JAVA” as it was already a trademark 
                by Oak Technologies."</p>
            <p>"“JAVA” Gosling and his team did a brainstorm session and after the session, they came up with several 
                names such as JAVA, DNA, SILK, RUBY, etc. Java name was decided after much discussion since it was so 
                unique. The name Java originates from a sort of espresso bean, Java. Gosling came up with this name 
                while having a coffee near his office. Java was created on the principles like Robust, Portable, Platform 
                Independent, High Performance, Multithread, etc. and was called one of the Ten Best Products of 1995 by 
                the TIME MAGAZINE. Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business 
                solutions, etc. The Java language has experienced a few changes since JDK 1.0 just as various augmentations
                of classes and packages to the standard library. In Addition to the language changes, considerably more 
                sensational changes have been made to the Java Class Library throughout the years, which has developed from 
                a couple of hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to more than three thousand in J2SE 5."</p>

            "C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that is known for its efficiency and performance. 
            It is often used for systems programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications. 
            C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, providing developers with a high 
            degree of control over hardware resources. It allows manual memory management, which can lead to optimized 
            code but also requires careful handling to avoid memory leaks. C++ is a compiled language, and its syntax is 
            derived from the C programming language, making it a versatile language for low-level programming."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent 
            through its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy. Java applications are compiled into bytecode,
            which can be executed on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java suitable for developing 
            cross-platform applications, including web-based applications, enterprise software, and mobile 
            applications for Android. Java's object-oriented nature encourages modular and scalable code design, 
            while its garbage collection feature simplifies memory management, reducing the risk of memory-related errors."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
            It emphasizes code readability and developer productivity, making it a popular choice for beginners 
            and experienced developers alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, 
            object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of 
            third-party libraries, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, such as web development, 
            data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation. Python's dynamic typing and automatic memory 
            management contribute to faster development cycles but may impact performance in certain scenarios."

                "Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that follows a concise and 
                structured syntax. The basic structure of a Java program includes the declaration of a 
                class, the main method as the entry point of the program, and various constructs such as
                variables, data types, control flow statements, and methods. The syntax for declaring a 
                class involves using the class keyword followed by the class name, and the main method is
                declared with the public static void main<strong>(String[] args)</strong> signature. 
                Statements within the main method are enclosed within curly braces <strong>{}</strong>. 
                Variables are declared using a combination of the data type and the variable name, and Java
                supports various primitive data types such as int, double, char, and boolean. Control flow 
                statements like if, else, switch, while, do-while, and for are used to manage the flow of 
                execution based on conditions or loops. Methods, defined using the <strong>returnType methodName(parameters)</strong>
                syntax, encapsulate reusable blocks of code, contributing to modular and organized programming. 
                Syntax conventions include ending statements with semicolons (;), using camelCase for variable and 
                method names, and indentation for code readability. The object-oriented nature of Java involves 
                creating objects from classes, utilizing concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. 
                Additionally, Java includes exception handling with try, catch, and finally blocks for graceful error 
                management. Overall, Java's syntax emphasizes readability, simplicity, and a strict structure, making 
                it suitable for a wide range of applications from desktop to web and mobile development."

                "Java supports a variety of data types that can be broadly categorized into two main groups:
                primitive data types and reference data types. Primitive data types include integral types 
                (such as int, byte, short, long, and char), floating-point types (float and double), and a 
                boolean type (boolean). These types represent basic values and are stored directly in memory. 
                On the other hand, reference data types include classes, interfaces, arrays, and enumerations. 
                They store references to objects rather than the actual data. The choice of data type depends on 
                the nature of the data and the requirements of the program. Java enforces strong typing, meaning 
                that variables must be declared with a specific type before they can be used, contributing to code 
                safety and reliability."

                such as a variable, method, class, or label. Identifiers are essential for uniquely identifying 
                and referencing these entities within the code. They follow certain rules and conventions, such 
                as starting with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($), followed by letters, digits, 
                underscores, or dollar signs. Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase
